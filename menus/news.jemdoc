- (07-01-2019) I ended my 23-year student career and started working at [http://www.lreis.ac.cn LREIS] as an assistant professor.
- (01-31-2019) Our manuscript entitled "[/BMPsCfgUnitsCmp_Water.html Effects of different spatial configuration units for spatial optimization of watershed 
best management practices scenarios]" is accepted by /Water/. [https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/2/262 Online version] 
- (01-09-2018) We proposed a spatial BMP optimization approach based on slope position units, which are homogeneous spatial units with physical 
geographic features. The manuscript entitled "[/BMPsOptSlpPos-JSWC.html Spatial optimization of watershed best management practices based on slope position units]"
is accepted by /Journal of Soil and Water Conservation/. The paper is freely available via the 
[http://www.jswconline.org/content/73/5/504 offical website]. The software can be found [https://github.com/lreis2415/SEIMS here].
- (12-15-2017) I have developed an automatic approach of the [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X0900155X 
prototype-based fuzzy slope position] which is originally proposed by [http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~qincz Prof. Cheng-Zhi Qin]. 
The accordingly manuscript entitled "[/AutoFuzSlpPos-GEMOR.html Automatic approach for deriving fuzzy slope positions]" 
is accepted by /Geomorphology/. The software can be found [https://github.com/lreis2415/AutoFuzSlpPos here].
