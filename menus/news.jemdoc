- (2023-02-24) The undergraduate thesis work of Tong Wu, whom I co-supervised with Prof. Qin, titled
[/PMAIdentifySlpPos-JoH.html Identification of watershed priority management areas based on landscape positions: An implementation using SWAT\+]
has been published in the Journal of Hydrology. This work builds upon the fundamental idea we proposed in 2018 of [/BMPsOptSlpPos-JSWC.html optimizing watershed BMPs based on slope position units].
It clarified the concept of priority management areas (PMA) in a watershed and proposed that landscape position units are more suitable to be used as PMA identification units than subbasin units.
The work summarizes and improves a framework for identifying PMAs using spatial units with upstream and downstream relationships as identification units. The framework is implemented using the SWAT+
model and an improved Markov chain-based surrogate model for pollutant source apportionment.
