- (2020-10-12) On the invitation of Professor [https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/john-p-wilson/ John Wilson],
Professor [http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~qincz Cheng-Zhi Qin] and I wrote an entry about Geospatial data Input\/Output
(IO) libraries--[https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/gdalogr-and-geospatial-data-io-libraries GDAL/OGR and Geospatial Data IO Libraries]
for [https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-basic-page/welcome-gist-body-knowledge GIS&T Body of Knowledge].
- (2020-09-15) I attend the 10th iEMSs conference, the [https://iemss2020.com/ iEMSs2020] meeting (online),
organized by the [https://www.iemss.org/ iEMSs Society], and give an oral presentation entitled "New optimization framework
of watershed best management practice scenarios in a unit-boundary adaptive manner" to introduce our latest paper published
in /Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment/. [/BMPsBoundaryOpt-PPG.html Read Paper] and

- (2020-06-03) The core part of my PhD dissertation [/BMPsBoundaryOpt-PPG.html Spatial optimization of watershed best management practice scenarios
based on boundary-adaptive configuration units] has been accepted by /Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment/.
Published [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309133320939002 online] on Jul. 28.
- (2019-09-26) After a long wait, our manuscript of introducing the design and development of SEIMS (Spatially Explicit Integrated Modeling System)
which entitled "[/SEIMSFramework_EMS.html A modular and parallelized watershed modeling framework]" has finally been published online by
/Environmental Modelling \& Software/. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815218309241 Online version].
Source code of SEIMS can be found [https://github.com/lreis2415/SEIMS here].
- (2019-07-08) I ended my 23-year student career and started working at [http://www.lreis.ac.cn LREIS] as an assistant professor.
- (2019-01-31) Our manuscript entitled "[/BMPsCfgUnitsCmp_Water.html Effects of different spatial configuration units for spatial optimization of watershed
best management practices scenarios]" is accepted by /Water/. [https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/2/262 Online version]
- (2018-01-09) We proposed a spatial BMP optimization approach based on slope position units, which are homogeneous spatial units with physical
geographic features. The manuscript entitled "[/BMPsOptSlpPos-JSWC.html Spatial optimization of watershed best management practices based on slope position units]"
is accepted by /Journal of Soil and Water Conservation/. The paper is freely available via the
[http://www.jswconline.org/content/73/5/504 offical website]. The software can be found [https://github.com/lreis2415/SEIMS here].
- (2017-12-15) I have developed an automatic approach of the [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X0900155X
prototype-based fuzzy slope position] which is originally proposed by [http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~qincz Prof. Cheng-Zhi Qin].
The accordingly manuscript entitled "[/AutoFuzSlpPos-GEMOR.html Automatic approach for deriving fuzzy slope positions]"
is accepted by /Geomorphology/. The software can be found [https://github.com/lreis2415/AutoFuzSlpPos here].
