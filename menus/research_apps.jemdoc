== Apps and environments used in my research

[/research_apps.zh.html 中文版]

== Coding

I read\/use\/write cross-platform algorithms and applications with Python, C\/C\+\+, and a little Fortran,
especially high-performance programming of C\+\+ and Fortran with MPI and OpenMP.

The list of my favorite or customized softwares\/tools\/websites\/tool-chains is as follows:

- [https://code.visualstudio.com/ VSCode] for reading and writing almost everything related to plaintext format
- [https://cmake.org/ CMake] for building C\+\+ and Fortran programs
- [https://git-scm.com/ Git], [https://github.com Github], [https://bitbucket.org BitBucket], and
[https://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge] for version control of source code
- [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ PyCharm] together with [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ Anaconda Distribution]
for writing Python programs compatible with Python2.7 and Python3
- [https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ CLion] together with [https://www.msys2.org/ MSYS2/MinGW-w64] on Windows 10 and
[https://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] on Linux or macOS for C\+\+ and Fortran
- [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com Visual Studio] with [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/ ReSharper] and
[https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe Intel Parallel Studio XE] for C\+\+ and Fortran

Normally, I develop code on VS2015\/VS2010, test on MinGW-w64, Intel Parallel Studio XE, and Xcode,
and run on Linux cluster using GCC or Intel C++ compilers.

Here are my main configuration notes for building multiple coding environments.

  .. [/Coding-python-with-pycharm-anaconda.html Coding Python with PyCharm and Anaconda]
  .. [/Configure-msys2-git-under-windows.html Use the same Git version for both MSYS2/MinGW and Windows environments]
. Coding under macOS
  .. [/Coding-cpp-with-xcode.html Coding C\/C\+\+ with Xcode and Clang]
  .. [/Coding-cpp-fortran-clion-gcc-macos.html Coding C\/C\+\+ and Fortran with CLion and GCC]
. Coding under Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat). Since I often use Linux server without graphic interface,
here I will list some useful notes\/tips of configuring libraries\/software\/database etc.
